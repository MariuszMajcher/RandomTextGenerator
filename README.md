## Course from Codecademy called "Mixed messages"

~This little program will be generating random text using 3 arrays with specific purpose.~
~1. A line of text with 2 places for words to be replaced randomly~
~2. An adjective that will be in front of a noun.~
~3. An adverb that will be placed after a verb.~

## Scrap that... This program will have some more variables to make it more interesting

1. A text that will be at the beggining of the short story (setting the time)
2. Then a person object
3. Adverb
4. Another person object
5. Adverb of time
6. Averb of manner
7. Verb
8. Noun
9. And finally the very end

## Hope it will put some smiles on peoples faces! :)

There will be a button that will be used to run the program, after pressing it the Message will be displayed.
