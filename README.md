# RANDOM TEXT GENERATOR
>
>
## Course from Codecademy called "Mixed messages"

This little program will be generating random text using 3 arrays with specific purpose.
1. A line of text with 2 places for words to be replaced randomly
2. An adjective that will be in front of a noun.
3. An adverb that will be placed after a verb.

There will be a button that will be used to run the program, after pressing it the Message will be displayed.

**Might try to leave the point 2 and 3 for the user to type himself as an option.
